# burger

This app uses the MVC design pattern to create a burger logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a custom ORM.
The user is asked to input a burger name. Upon clicking the submit button, their burger is added to the left side of the app. A button to devour it appears. Clicking this will move it to the right side of the app. This uses a MySQL database to keep track of all burgers, and an ORM to update the database as users interact with the app.
